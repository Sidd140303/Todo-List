**React To-Do List**  
  
This React To-Do List application is a simple and efficient task management tool. It allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The tasks are dynamically displayed and persisted using the browser's localStorage, ensuring that your task list remains intact even after refreshing the page.

Features  
* Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks through a user-friendly input field.
* Remove Tasks: Tasks can be deleted from the list with a single click.
* Complete Tasks: Mark tasks as completed or pending by toggling their status.
* Dynamic Display: The list updates in real-time as tasks are added or removed.
* Local Storage: Tasks are stored in the browser's localStorage, preserving them across sessions.
* Input Validation: Prevents the addition of empty or duplicate tasks.

**Usage**
* Add a Task:

   * Type your task into the input field.
   * Click the "Add Task" button or press Enter to add it to the list.
   * If the input is empty or the task already exists, an error message will be displayed.
   * Remove a Task:

* Click the delete button (usually a trash icon) next to the task you wish to remove.
  
* Complete a Task:
  * Click on the task text to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are visually distinct (e.g., with a line through the text).
    
* Persist Tasks:
  * The tasks are automatically saved in the browser's localStorage. Refresh the page, and your tasks will remain.
